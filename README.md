Hi there! I am a bioinformatician specialized in sequence analysis with +10 years of experience in both academic and private sector.

My main scientific interests are gene transcriptional regulation, DNA sequence analysis and transcription factors. Currently I am working with protein cleavage, protein structure and developing bioinformatic pipelines.

My main programming expertise is in `R`, `python` and `perl` and in I'm a big fan of data visualization.

- 💬 Ask me about: bioinformatics of transcription factor binding motifs, gene expression regulation or design of negative controls.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning `rust`.
