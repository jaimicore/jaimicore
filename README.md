Hi there! I am a bioinformatician at [Nykode therapeutics](https://nykode.com/), previously I was working at the University of Oslo in [Anthony Mathelier's Lab](https://mathelierlab.com/).

My main scientific interests are gene transcriptional regulation, DNA sequence analysis and transcription factors.

My main programming expertise is in `R` and `perl`

- 💬 Ask me about: bioinformatics of transcription factor binding motifs, negative controls, or runes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning `python` and `c++`
