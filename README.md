Hi there! I am a post-doctoral researcher studying gene regulation at [NCMM](https://www.med.uio.no/ncmm/english/), in [Anthony Mathelier's Lab](https://mathelierlab.com/) in Oslo, Norway.

My main scientific interests are gene transcriptional regulation, DNA sequence analysis and transcription factors.

My main programming expertise is in `R` and `perl`

- 💬 Ask me about: bioinformatics of transcription factor binding motifs, `dplyr`, and runes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning `python` and `c++`
