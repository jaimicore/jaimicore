My main scientific interests are gene transcriptional regulation, DNA sequence analysis and transcription factors. Currently I am working with protein cleavage, protein structure and developing bioinformatic pipelines.

My main programming expertise is in `R`, `python` and `perl` and in I'm a big fan of data visualization.
